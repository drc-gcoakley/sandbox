# personal-testing
Useful for testing Jenkins build changes. 

Create a branch with your name, such as 'glen_coakley', and place any files you need in there to test. 
Please delete any Jenkins jobs that you only used for testing. 

Ensure that your IDE is configured to syntax highlight 'Jenksinsfile's. In IDEA,  Preferences > Editor > File Types > Groovy add 'Jenkinsfile'.
