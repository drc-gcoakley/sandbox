# Diff of all changes in your Workspace since the last commit to your local respository.

# From: man gitrevisions
# 
# HEAD names the commit on which you based the changes in the working tree.  
# FETCH_HEAD records the branch which you fetched from a remote repository with your last git 
#   fetch invocation.  
# ORIG_HEAD is created by commands that move your HEAD in a drastic way, to record the position
#   of the HEAD before their operation, so that you can easily change the tip of the branch back 
#   to the state before you ran them.  
# MERGE_HEAD records the commit(s) which you are merging into your branch when you run git merge.  
# CHERRY_PICK_HEAD records the commit which you are cherry-picking when you run git cherry-pick.

git diff HEAD .
