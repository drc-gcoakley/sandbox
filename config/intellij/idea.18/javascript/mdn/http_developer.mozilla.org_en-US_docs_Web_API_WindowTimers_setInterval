The <strong><code>setInterval()</code></strong> method of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope" title="The WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin describes several features common to the Window and WorkerGlobalScope interfaces. Each of these interfaces can, of course, add more features in addition to the ones listed below."><code>WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope</code></a> mixin repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. It returns an <code>interval</code> <code>ID</code> which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval" title="The clearInterval() method of the WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin cancels a timed, repeating action which was previously established by a call to setInterval()."><code>clearInterval()</code></a>. This method is offered on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window" title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window."><code>Window</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker" title="The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator.
